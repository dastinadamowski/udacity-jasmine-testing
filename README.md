# Udacity Feed Reader Testing Project

JavaScript / red-green-refactor workflow / Jasmine testing framework project for completion of [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1).


# Project Overview

This project provided a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, as they have already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! The project task was to take over the project, following the departure of original developer, and complete a set of tests using Jasmine.


## Run this Project

  * Clone or download ZIP
  * Open index.html

Try the                      >>>[LIVE DEMO](https://dastinadamowski.github.io/udacity-jasmine-testing/)<<< and see the "Red Green Refactor workflow in action"


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


## What have I learned?

How to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These are the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


Happy coding!
